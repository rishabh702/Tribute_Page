            <ul>
                <li>APJ Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, into a poor family. His father had only one boat to support
                    his
                    family.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kalam was a hardworking boy right from the beginning. At the tender age of five, he started selling
                    newspapers to help his father support the family. He did this job in the evenings after school. He
                    also
                    spent a great deal of time on his studies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kalam was fascinated by physics and mathematics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kalam completed his graduation from Saint Joseph’s College, Trichurapally in 1954. In 1955, he
                    enrolled
                    at the Madras Institute of Technology.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kalam missed an opportunity to become a fighter pilot for the Indian Air force. He was on the ninth
                    spot
                    on the list, and there were only eight openings. The first eight shortlisted candidates were
                    recruited.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 1960, Kalam became involved with DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Establishment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 1969, Kalam was made the project director for Satellite Launch Vehicles and was shifted to ISRO.
                    The
                    project became successful, and India, under the directorship of Kalam, was able to launch the Rohini
                    satellite series into Earth’s orbit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kalam was known as the ‘Missile Man’ of India due to his continued, successful work with ballistic
                    missiles and launch vehicle technology.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kalam also made significant contributions to the nuclear capabilities of India. The Pokhran -2
                    nuclear
                    tests (in 1998) were successful thanks to his organizational and technical support.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kalam was honored with many awards, including the highest civilian award in the country, the Bharat
                    Ratna (1997). His other awards include Padma Bhushan (1981) and Padma Vibhushan (1990).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kalam’s visit to Switzerland is commemorated as Science Day in the country. This declaration in his
                    honor was made by the Swiss government after the sad demise of this great personality.
